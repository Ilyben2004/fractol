# The complexPlaneWidth is how much of the real axis we can see
# in our bitmap viewport; making this number smaller would mean
# more "zoom". And changing the complexPlaneLeftEdgeCoord would
# mean panning left and right:

complexPlaneWidth = 2
complexPlaneLeftEdgeCoord = -2

# And here is our bitmap width in pixels:

bitmapWidth = 400

# The following function converts an x pixel coordinate on the
# bitmap plane into the corresponding real coordinate on the
# complex plane:

computeRealPartFromX(x):

    # x was in the range 0-to-bitmapWidth;
    # we want to remap it to the range 0-to-1:

    f = x / bitmapWidth  # floating-point calculation

    # Now f is in the range 0-to-1; remap it to the range
    # 0-to-complexPlaneWidth:

    realPart = f * complexPlaneWidth

    # Finally, we need to shift it over from the range
    #    0-to-complexPlaneWidth
    #
    # to
    #
    # complexPlaneLeftEdgeCoord-to-
    #        (complexPlaneLeftEdgeCoord + complexPlaneWidth)

    realPart = realPart + complexPlaneLeftEdgeCoord

    return realPart
